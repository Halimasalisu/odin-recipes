    <p><h1>How to make proper Nigerian spaghetti with meatbals</h1></p>
    Spaghetti does not originate from Nigeria but spaghetti is a meal we all cherish and it is prepared in a similar fashion as Jollof rice
   <p>Ingredients list</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Spaghetti</li>
      <li>Oil (you can use any type of oil of your choice</li>
      <li>Spice</li>
      <li>Seasoning</li>
      <li>Grated Fresh pepper</li>
      <li>Grated Fresh onion</li>
      <li>Meat</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Put cups of water into pot to boil</li>
      <li>When the water is boiling put the spagetti inside the pot of boiling water</li>
      <li>As a preventive measure to avoid your spag sticking inside the pot sprinkle drops of oil</li>
      <li>Now after it boils for a while filter the water out of it. The reason we do this in Nigeria is because we believe the local spagetti they make for us at home can be quite starchy</li>
      <li>While your spaghetti is inside a filter or any medium you used to filter water out of, put oil in a pot or the pot you previously used to boil the spag and put your grated fresh pepper and onions into the hot oil.</li>
      <li>Stir your fresh pepper and onions for a while and then start adding your spices and seasoning in any order you want</li>
      <p><i>has anyone forgotten our meatballs</i></p>
      <h3>Now here's to make our meatballs</h3>
      <li>First wash and put your meat inside a pot of boiling water</li>
      <li>Then put your spice and seasoning as you see fit</li>
      <li>Then slice onions and put inside your meat combo</li>
      <li>Wait till it's well cooked, then remove all that meat and blend</li>
      <li>Use your hands to mold your meatballs into the ball shape</li>
      <li>When you are through fry your meatballs however you like it (but don't burn it oo)</li>
      <li>Now you can put your meatballs into the sauce combo you originally prepared</li>
      <li>While your sauce combo is boiling you can now put your spaghetti to cook</li>
      <li>Stir occassionally but <i>not too much oo, make your spaghetti no turn to pudding</i></li>
    </ol>

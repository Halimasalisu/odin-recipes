      you will just no the temperature by instinct</i>). The main ingredient the dried, grounded, seeds pf the African mango or as our

      rest of us (also called scientists) named it  <i>Irvingia</i>
      So after heating the water to a minimum temperature you can start adding your ingredients.</p>
